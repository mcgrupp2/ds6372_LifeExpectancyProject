22 Variables, 20 of them are Numerical, and 2 of them are Categorical.
Variables we should drop: Country, Year
Hepatitis.B has the Min Value and 1st Quartile difference of 76 which is too high (Factor?)
Polio has the Min value and 1st QUartile difference of 70 which is too high (Factor?)
Diphtheria has the min value and 1st quartile difference of 78 which is too high (Factor?)

According to the World Health Organization in 2018 they said that
86% of children in the world are receiving immunizations protecting them from these diseases.
Source: https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/global-immunization/diseases-and-vaccines-world-view
Let us use 86% as the benchmark to turn these columns into factors.

```{r Skewed immunizations as factors}
life_new <- life %>% 
  select(-Country, -Year) %>% 
  mutate(Hepatitis_B = ifelse(Hepatitis_B < 86, "<86% Immunized", ">=86% Immunized"),
         Polio = ifelse(Polio < 86, "<86% Immunized", ">=86% Immunized"),
         Diphtheria = ifelse(Diphtheria < 86, "<86% Immunized", ">=86% Immunized"),
         Hepatitis_B = as.factor(Hepatitis_B),
         Polio = as.factor(Polio),
         Diphtheria = as.factor(Diphtheria))
str(life_new)
```



Check the correlation of the numerical variables
```{r Correlation Numeric}
life_numerical <- life_new %>% 
  select_if(is.numeric)
ggcorr(life_numerical, 
       label = T, 
       label_size = 2,
       label_round = 2,
       hjust = 1,
       size = 3, 
       color = "black",
       layout.exp = 5,
       low = "forestgreen", 
       mid = "gray95", 
       high = "darkorange",
       name = "Correlation")
```



Life_expectancy has a strong negative correlation with Adult_Mortality
which is understandable since if mortality rate in adults is high, Life
exepctancy would be lower. Let us compare our Correlation Matrix with a VIF 
model to see which columns we should drop.



```{r check VIFs and compare to correlation plot to determine which columns to drop}
life_df_fctr2 <- life_new  #removing the country name, indicator vars
life_fctr2model <- lm(Life_expectancy~.,data=life_df_fctr2)  # . means all variable not mpg
vif(life_fctr2model)

```



Life Expenctancy has a strong positive correlation with Schooling 
and Income_composition_of_resources but Schooling and Income_composition_of_resources have
a high correlation with one another. Income_composition_of_resources has a VIF of 11.35 (vs 7.47 for Schooling) so let's drop that.

Infant_deaths and under.five_deaths have a correlation of 1 (100%) which would
tell us that there is multicollinearity between them. Both have extremely high VIFs, so we should drop one of the variables. and I believe under 5 deaths should be dropped since it covers more ages and includes infant deaths within it.

Percentage_expenditure vs GDP is also highly correlated with one another with both values having high VIFs. GDP is a more well known datapoint and has a higher correlation with Life_expectancy, so let's remove percentage_expenditure.

thinness_5-9_years has a strong correlation with thinness_1-19_years and both have high VIFs. Let's drop thinness_5-9_years since thinness_1-19_years should have years 5-9 within it as well.

```{r drop columns and rerun VIFs}

#removes Infant_deaths, Income_composition_of_resources, thinness_5-9_years, and percentage_expenditure.
life_new<- life_new[-c(6,10,18:19)]

life_df_fctr2 <- life_new 
life_fctr2model <- lm(Life_expectancy~.,data=life_df_fctr2)  
vif(life_fctr2model)

```
The VIFs now look good for the numerical variables.

## Including Plots

##Check the distribution of the categorical variables


```{r Status Variable, echo=FALSE}
life_new %>% 
  group_by(Status) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(percentage = paste0(round(count/sum(count)*100, 2), "%"))
life_plot <-  ggplot(life_new, aes(x=Status, y = Life_expectancy, fill = Status)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("forestgreen", "darkorange")) +
  labs(x = "Status", y = "Life Expectancy (Age)") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
ggplotly(life_plot)
```

According to the boxplots, the distribution of higher life_expectancy resides
in the developed countries, with the plot even showing that the median for developed
countries (2nd Quartile) beind skewed higher towards the 3rd quartile


We want to know if there is any significant difference between the 
average life expectancy in Developed and Developing countries.

```{r ANOVA}
summary(aov(Life_expectancy ~ Status, data = life_new))
```


The ANOVA test tells us that there is a significant difference between the life expectancy
of Developed countries and the life expectancy of Developing countries.


```{r Hepatitis_B Variable, echo=FALSE}
life_new %>% 
  group_by(Hepatitis_B) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(percentage = paste0(round(count/sum(count)*100, 2), "%"))
life_plot2 <-  ggplot(life_new, aes(x=Hepatitis_B, y = Life_expectancy, fill = Hepatitis_B)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("forestgreen", "darkorange")) +
  labs(x = "Hepatitis B Immunizations", y = "Life Expectancy (Age)") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
ggplotly(life_plot2)
```

More than 1/3 of countries have less than 86% immunized for Hepatitis B.
The Life Expectancy of the countries with greater than or equal to 86% Immunized is higher than
the countries which have less that 86% Immunized. Note that the median (2nd Quartile) for >=86% immunized
is skewed upwards towards the 3rd quartile.


We want to know if there is any significant difference between the 
average life expectancy in Developed and Developing countries.

```{r ANOVA2}
summary(aov(Life_expectancy ~ Hepatitis_B, data = life_new))
```


The ANOVA test tells us that there is a significant difference between the life expectancy
of countries that immmunized >=86% and the life expectancy of countries that immunized less than 86% for Hep B.



```{r Polio Variable, echo=FALSE}
life_new %>% 
  group_by(Polio) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(percentage = paste0(round(count/sum(count)*100, 2), "%"))
life_plot3 <-  ggplot(life_new, aes(x=Polio, y = Life_expectancy, fill = Polio)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("forestgreen", "darkorange")) +
  labs(x = "Polio Immunizations", y = "Life Expectancy (Age)") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
ggplotly(life_plot3)
```

For Polio Immunizations, higher life expectancy resides with the countries 
that have >=86% Immunized.
Note that the median (2nd Quartile) for >=86% immunized
is skewed upwards towards the 3rd quartile.

```{r ANOVA3}
summary(aov(Life_expectancy ~ Polio, data = life_new))
```


According to the ANOVA test, there is a significant difference between the life expectancy
of countries that immmunized >=86% and the life expectancy of countries that immunized less than 86% for Polio.




```{r Diptheria Variable, echo=FALSE}
life_new %>% 
  group_by(Diphtheria) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(percentage = paste0(round(count/sum(count)*100, 2), "%"))
life_plot4 <-  ggplot(life_new, aes(x=Diphtheria, y = Life_expectancy, fill = Diphtheria)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("forestgreen", "darkorange")) +
  labs(x = "Diphtheria Immunizations", y = "Life Expectancy (Age)") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
ggplotly(life_plot4)
```

For Diphtheria Immunizations, higher life expectancy resides with the countries 
that have >=86% Immunized.
Note that the median (2nd Quartile) for >=86% immunized
is skewed upwards towards the 3rd quartile.

```{r ANOVA4}
summary(aov(Life_expectancy ~ Diphtheria, data = life_new))
```


According to the ANOVA test, there is a significant difference between the life expectancy
of countries that immmunized >=86% and the life expectancy of countries that immunized less than 86% for Diphtheria.

```{r Hepatitis_B vs Status}
life_plot5 <-  ggplot(life_new) +
            geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(Status), fill=Hepatitis_B)) +
            labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +
            scale_fill_manual(values=c("forestgreen", "cadetblue")) +
            labs(x = "Status", y = "Hepatitis_B Immunizations") +
            theme(legend.position = "none")

ggplotly(life_plot5) 

chisq.test(table(life_new$Status, life_new$Hepatitis_B))
```


A larger percentage of Developed countries have >=86% of their people immunized for Hepatitis_B.
The Chi-Squared test tells us that Developed and Developing Countries have different coverage of Hepatitis_B immunizations.


```{r Polio vs Status}
life_plot6 <-  ggplot(life_new) +
            geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(Status), fill=Polio)) +
            labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +
            scale_fill_manual(values=c("forestgreen", "cadetblue")) +
            labs(x = "Status", y = "Polio Immunizations") +
            theme(legend.position = "none")

ggplotly(life_plot6) 

chisq.test(table(life_new$Status, life_new$Polio))
```


ALL of the Developed countries have >=86% of their people immunized for Polio.
The Chi-Squared test tells us that Developed and Developing Countries have different coverage of Polio immunizations.

```{r Diphtheria vs Status}
life_plot7 <-  ggplot(life_new) +
            geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(Status), fill=Diphtheria)) +
            labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +
            scale_fill_manual(values=c("forestgreen", "cadetblue")) +
            labs(x = "Status", y = "Diphtheria Immunizations") +
            theme(legend.position = "none")

ggplotly(life_plot7) 

chisq.test(table(life_new$Status, life_new$Diphtheria))
```


ALL of the Developed countries have >=86% of their people immunized for Diphtheria
The Chi-Squared test tells us that Developed and Developing Countries have different coverage of Diphtheria immunizations.

These numbers are very similar to Polio numbers, there could be evidence that Polio and Diphteria immunizations are done at the same time therefore one of them could be dropped. Let us see in the next section.



```{r Model Creation}
life_lm <- lm(formula = Life_expectancy ~., data = life_new)
summary(life_lm)
```

Coefficients that are negative: StatusDeveloping, Adult_Mortality, infant_deaths, Hepatitis_B>=86% Immunized, Polio>=86% Immunized, HIV/AIDS, and thinness__1-19_years. This tells us that everytime we add one of these variables we expect Life_expectancy to decrease.
Diphtheria>=86% Immunized is expected to raise Life_expectancy while Hepatitis_B>=86% Immunized and Polio>=86% Immunized are exoected to decrease Life_expectancy.
Adult_Mortality, HIV/AIDS, and Schooling are seen as the best predictors of Life_expectancy according to the model. 

According to the Adj. R-Squared, 82.55% of the variation in Life_expectancy can be determined by the model's inputed values. This is a very good value for the model.
```{r Stepwise}
life_step <- lm(formula = Life_expectancy ~., data = life_new)
life_step0 <- lm(formula = Life_expectancy ~1, data = life_new)
```

```{r backwards}
life_backward <- step(life_step, direction = "backward")
summary(life_backward)
```

```{r forwards}
life_forward <- step(life_step0, scope = list(lower = life_step0, upper = life_step) ,direction = "forward")
summary(life_forward)
```

```{r both}
life_both <- step(life_step, scope = list(lower = life_step0, upper = life_step) ,direction = "both")
summary(life_both)
```


According to each feature selection, the 3 variables that have the most siginificance with regards to Life_expectancy are Adult_Mortality, HIV/AIDS, and Schooling. They have the lowest p-values in each of the selection methods as well as chosen by the model with '***' next to them.

Let us create a model with just these variables.

```{r High p-value variables only}
life_highp <- lm(formula = Life_expectancy ~ Adult_Mortality + `HIV/AIDS` + Schooling, data = life_new)

summary(life_highp)
```

```{r compare Adj R-Squared between Models}
data.frame(model = c("life_backward","life_forward","life_both", "life_highp"), 
           AdjRsquare = c(summary(life_backward)$adj.r.square,
                          summary(life_forward)$adj.r.square,
                          summary(life_both)$adj.r.square,
                          summary(life_highp)$adj.r.square))

```


Given the Adj R-Squared Value for forward, backward, and both direction models are the same, we can choose whichever model we want. We will select Backwards Selection Model.


```{r Model Error check vs Range}
life_pred <- predict(life_backward, life_new)

data.frame(Method = c("MSE","RMSE","MAE", "MAPE"), 
           Error = c(MSE(life_pred, life_new$Life_expectancy),
                          RMSE(life_pred, life_new$Life_expectancy),
                          MAE(life_pred, life_new$Life_expectancy),
                          MAPE(life_pred, life_new$Life_expectancy)))
 range(life_new$Life_expectancy)
```


The error values are quite small compared to the range of values for Life_expectancy. This means we can expect the model's predicted values to be close to the actual values.

Let us check assumptions of the Model to see if it passes:


```{r Histogram of residuals}
hist(life_backward$residuals, breaks = 20)
```

The histogram looks fairly normally distributed with the higher frequency residuals more towards the center.


```{r QQ plot of residuals}
plot(life_backward, which = 2)
```

The QQ plot looks fairly linear as the the majority of the values fall along the line of best fit.

```{r Shapiro-Wilk normality Test}


shapiro.test(life_backward$residuals)


```

Our Shapiro-Wilk Test shows that we do not pass normality of residuals

```{r Cooks D Outlier}
plot(cooks.distance(life_backward))
```

Cook's D also tells us we have outliers present in the data. We will try taking the Log of the numerical values within the model to see if this sovles our 

plot(life_backward$residuals)
